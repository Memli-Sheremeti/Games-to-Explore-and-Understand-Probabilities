# Games-to-Explore-and-Understand-Probabilities

Welcome to the **Games to Explore and Understand Probabilities** repository! This project features a variety of Python-based games and simulations that make learning probability concepts engaging and interactive. Whether you're an educator, a student, or just curious about probabilities, this repository provides fun and educational resources.

---

## üéØ **Purpose**
This repository is designed to:
- Help users understand key probability concepts.
- Provide hands-on learning through classic problems and games.
- Encourage Python programming skills with practical applications.

---

## üìö **Contents**
This repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. **Guess the Number**
- **Folder:** `Guess_The_Number/`
- **Description:** A game where the computer selects a random number, and different methods (binary search and stochastic search) are used to guess it.
- **Goal:** Explore random number generation and compare search strategies.
- **Files:**
  - `__main__.py`: Main file to run the game.
  - `binary_search.py`: Implements a binary search guessing method.
  - `stochastic_search.py`: Implements a stochastic search guessing method.
  - `user_test_game.py`: Allows the user to guess the number interactively.

### 2. **Monty Hall Problem**
- **Folder:** `Monty_Hall_Problem/`
- **Description:** Simulates the Monty Hall paradox, a famous probability puzzle involving choosing between three doors.
- **Goal:** Analyze the effects of switching vs. sticking strategies.
- **Files:**
  - `monty_hall.py`: Main file to run the Monty Hall simulation.
  - `README.md`: Explains the Monty Hall problem and how to run the simulation.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required dependencies (installable via `pip`).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd Games-to-Explore-and-Understand-Probabilities
   ```

### Running the Games
- To run **Guess the Number**, navigate to the `Guess_The_Number/` folder and execute:
  ```bash
  python __main__.py (or any file)

  ```

- To run the **Monty Hall Problem** simulation, navigate to the `Monty_Hall_Problem/` folder and execute:
  ```bash
  python monty_hall.py
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Future Enhancements**
Here are some ideas for expanding the repository:
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Incorporate `matplotlib` or `pygame` to create visual aids for the games and simulations.
- **Additional Games:** Add more probability-focused games such as:
  - Coin flip simulations.
  - Dice roll probabilities.
  - Lottery simulations.
- **Web Interface:** Develop a web-based interface using Flask or Django for easier interaction.
